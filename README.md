Module 13 - Challenge 13 : Venture Funding with Deep Learning
==========================================

## Purpose

 The purpose of this notebook is to analyze startups and determine their success in being funded by a large VC. Neural networks were used to predict the results. 

---

## Technologies

Jupyter notebooks and the Pandas data analysis library were used in the creation of this project. Additionaly TensorFlow and Keras packages were leveraged for the creation of the notebook and following analysis. 

---

## Installation Guide

First, install the jupyter and pandas libraries. In your terminal or command shell install the following packages: 

```python
pip install jupyter
```

```python
pip install pandas
```

```python
pip install tensorflow
```

```python
pip install sklearn
```



This notebook was created using python 3.7.10. There were a number of issues with the packages within this specific conda environment, and I definitely recommend taking time to troubleshoot any package discrepencies that may arise. 

---
## Conclusion

Contained within the notebook are the results of the analysis. If I were to improve on this project.
